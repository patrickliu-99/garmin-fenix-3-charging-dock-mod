A quick PCB to add USB C charging to the Garmin Fenix 3 charging dock. Project made in KiCad 5.

# About
One of the charging clips I had for my Fenix 3 HR started failing - looked like the cable was damaged from overuse. I saw on Amazon that
replacements were available using USB micro B and figured I could do one better with USB C.

After a little fiddling about in KiCad, this project was made. More info to come on manufacturing and so on.
